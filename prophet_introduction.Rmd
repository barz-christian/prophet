# Prophet's goals and alternative
## Prophet library
The Prophet library^[Taylor, Letham, Forecasting at scale, 2017, The American Statistician] is a model and a framework, that targets

 - non-experts with background business knowledge
 - less knowledge about time series is required
 - easy to configure (analyst in the loop)
 - easily interpretable parameters
 - flexible for a wide range of business problems

## Alternative 

The `forecast` R-package contains some alternative for automated times series models.

- `auto.arima`^[Hyndman, Khandakar et al. 2007, Automatic time series for forecasting: the
forecast package for R], fits mutliple ARIMA models and take the best fit
- `ets`^[Hyndman, Koehler., Snyder & Grose, 2002, `A state space framework
for automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods'], fits mutliple exponential smoothing models and take the best fit
- `snaive`^[De Livera, Hyndman. & Snyder, 2011, `A state space framework for
automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods'], random walk model with seasonality

# Prophet model

## Generalized additive models
Prophet uses a generalized additive model (GAM)^[Hastie & Tibshirani, 1987, `Generalized additive models: some applications']
$$
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) +\epsilon_t
$$

- $y(t)$ target
- $g(t)$ trend function
- $s(t)$ seasonal model
- $h(t)$ represents holiday effects, i.e. irregular schedules over one or more days
- $\epsilon_t$ error term (not accomodated by the model)

## The trend model

Trend can be modeled by

- saturated growth model
- piecewise linear model

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (basic)

A basic logistic growth model is given by
$$
g(t) = \frac{C}{1+exp(-k(t-m))}
$$
where 

- $C$ is the carrying capacity (upper bound)
- $k$ is the growth rate
- $m$ is an offset parameter


## Nonlinear Saturating growth (time dependent parameters)

- $C$ (carrying capacity) and $k$ (growth rate) are usually not constant
- incoporate trend changes by explicite defined change points
- change point can be set by analyst (e.g. product launches) or automatically selected


## Nonlinear Saturating growth (time dependent carrying capacity)

TBA - this is not explained in the non reviewed paper

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (non constant growth rate - idea)

let $s_1,\ldots,s_n$ be change points (time stamps).

define $\delta\in \mathbb{R}^n$ (vector of growth rate adjustments)

define growth rate at time $t$ by
$$
k(t) := k + \sum_{j:s_j<t} \delta_j
$$
where $k$ is the base growth rate

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (non constant growth rate - mathematically correct)

define $a(t)\in\{0,1\}^n$ by
$$
a_j(t) := 
\begin{cases}
1, \text{ for } t\leq s_j \\
0, otherwise
\end{cases}
$$
then rate at time $t$ is given by

$$
k(t) := k + a(t)^T\delta
$$

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (non constant growth rate - mathematically correct 2)

The offset parameter $m$ is than adjusted according to the change points by:
$$
\gamma_i := \left( s_j - m -\sum_{l<j}\gamma_j\right)\left(1-\frac{k+\sum_{l<j}\delta_l}{k+\sum_{l\leq j}\delta_l} \right)
$$

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (non constant growth rate - mathematically correct 3)



Putting all together we recieve :

$$
\begin{aligned}
g(t) &= \frac{C(t)}{1+exp(-k(t)(t-m(t))} \\
     &= \frac{C(t)}{1+\exp(-(k+a(t)^T\delta)(t-(m+a(t)^T\gamma)))}
\end{aligned}
$$


## Linear trend with Changepoints

using the change points from above a piecewise linear model is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
g(t) &= k(t)\cdot t + m(t) \\
     &:= (k+a(t)^T \delta)*t +(m+a(t)^T\gamma)
\end{aligned}
$$

## To do 

- We have to fit the unknown parameters $k$, $m$, and $\delta$
- recall Bayes theorem
$$
P(\delta | Data) = \frac{P(Data | \delta) \cdot P(\delta)}{P(Data)}
$$

where

- $P(\delta | Data)$ is the conditional probability to observe $\delta$ given $Data$
- $P(Data | \delta)$ is the likelihood, which can be interpreted as the probability to observe $Data$ given $\delta$

## Automatic changepoint selection

Change points are automatically detected by putting a sparse prior on $\delta$, i.e.
$$
\delta_j \sim Laplace(0,\tau)
$$

## The seasonal model

The seasonality is approximated by a (truncated) Fourier serie:

$$
s(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N(a_n\cos(\frac{2\pi it}{P}) + b_n\frac{2\pi it}{P}))
$$
where

- P is the period in days, for example P =7 for weekly seasonality
- N truncates the series and is a model parameter for the user to adjust the fitting

## The seasonal model (fitting) 

Fitting requires to estimate $2N$ parameters $\beta=(a_1,b_1,\ldots,a_N,b_N)$. 

This is done by constructing a matrix of seasonality vectors for each $t$ in our historical and future data, e.g. for weekly seasonality and $N=3$

$$
X(t) := (\cos(\frac{2\pi (1) t}{7}),\ldots,\sin(\frac{2\pi (3) t}{7}))
$$

Hence the seasonal component is

$$
s(t) X(t)\cdot\beta
$$

where the prior on $\beta$ is normaly distributed: $\beta \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^2)$.


## Fourier series

TBF

- recall how is an element in an vector space is represented in a basis
- the functions $e_k(x):=\exp(\frac{2\pi ikx}{P})$ is a basis of a (dense) subspace in the vector space of $P$ periodic functions
- the basis functions $e_k$ can be expressed as a function in $\sin$ and $\cos$
- convergence of Fourier series

# Stan model and fitting

Stan is a platform for Bayesian inference using MCMC sampling and more.

## Stan model with logistic growth trend model
```{r, eval=FALSE}
model {
// Priors
k ~ normal(0, 5);
m ~ normal(0, 5);
epsilon ~ normal(0, 0.5);
delta ~ double_exponential(0, tau);
beta ~ normal(0, sigma);
// Logistic likelihood
y ~ normal(C ./ (1 + exp(-(k + A * delta) 
                         .* (t - (m + A * gamma)))) +
             X * beta, epsilon);
}
```
## Stan fitting for prophet

- Prophet uses the L-BFGS algorithm from Stan to fit the GAM
- BFGS = Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm, quasi Newton method

# Future Talk's 
## regarding Prophet

- how the time dependet carrying capacity is determined ?
- how additional regressors are included ?
- how outliers are handeled ?


## theoretical background

- Stan models
- GAMS
- Baysian models
- L-BFGS
- Marcov chain Monte Carlo
