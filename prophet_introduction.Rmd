# Prophet's goals and alternative
## Prophet library
The Prophet library^[Taylor, Letham, Forecasting at scale, 2017, The American Statistician] is a model and a framework.

- targets at non-experts with background business knowledge
- less knowledge about time series is required
- easy to configure
- easily interpretable parameters
- flexible for a wide range of business problems

## Alternative 

The `forecast` R-package contains some alternative for automated times series models.

- `auto.arima`^[Hyndman, Khandakar et al. 2007, Automatic time series for forecasting: the
forecast package for R], fits mutliple ARIMA models and take the best fit
- `ets`^[Hyndman, Koehler., Snyder & Grose, 2002, `A state space framework
for automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods'], fits mutliple exponential smoothing models and take the best fit
- `snaive`^[De Livera, Hyndman. & Snyder, 2011, `A state space framework for
automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods'], random walk model with seasonality

# Prophet model

## Generalized additive models
Prophet uses a generalized additive model (GAM)^[Hastie & Tibshirani, 1987, `Generalized additive models: some applications']
$$
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) +\epsilon_t
$$

- $y(t)$ target
- $g(t)$ trend function
- $s(t)$ Foruier serie for periodic changes
- $h(t)$ represents holiday effects, i.e. irregular schedules over one or more days
- $\epsilon_t$ error term (not accomodated by the model)

## The trend model

Trend can be modeled with

- saturated growth model
- piecewise linear model

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (basic)

$$
g(t) = \frac{C}{1+exp(-k(t-m))}
$$

- $C$ carrying capacity (upper bound)
- $k$ growth rate
- $m$ offset parameter


## Nonlinear Saturating growth (time dependent parameters)

- $C$ (carrying capacity) and $k$ (growth rate) are usually not constant
- incoporate trend changes by explicite defined change points
- change point can be set by analyst (e.g. product launches) or automatically selected


## Nonlinear Saturating growth (time dependent carrying capacity)

TBA - this is not explained in the non reviewed paper

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (non constant growth rate - idea)

let $s_1,\ldots,s_n$ be change points (time stamps).

define $\delta\in \mathbb{R}^n$ (vector of rate adjustments)

define growth rate at time $t$ by
$$
k(t) := k + \sum_{j:s_j<t} \delta_j
$$
where $k$ is the base growth rate

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (non constant growth rate - mathematically correct)

define $a(t)\in\{0,1\}^n$ by
$$
a_j(t) := 
\begin{cases}
1, \text{ for } t\leq s_j \\
0, otherwise
\end{cases}
$$
then rate at time $t$ is given by

$$
k(t) := a(t)^T\delta
$$

## Nonlinear Saturating growth (non constant growth rate - mathematically correct)

The offset parameter $m$ is than adjusted according to the change points by a formula:
$$
\gamma:=f(s,m,k,\delta).
$$
Putting all together we recieve :

$$
g(t) = \frac{C(t)}{1+\exp(-(k+a(t)^T\delta)(t-(m+a(t)^T\gamma)))}
$$

## Linear trend with Changepoints

using the change points from above a piecewise linear model is given by

$$
g(t)  :=  (k+a(t)^T\delta)*t +(m+a(t)^T\gamma)
$$

## Automatic changepoint selection

Change points are automatically detected by putting a sparse prior on $\delta$, i.e.
$$
\delta_j ~ Laplace(0,\tau)
$$

# Stan model and fitting

Stan is a platform for Bayesian inference using MCMC sampling and more.

## Stan model with logistic growth trend model
```{r, eval=FALSE}
model {
// Priors
k ~ normal(0, 5);
m ~ normal(0, 5);
epsilon ~ normal(0, 0.5);
delta ~ double_exponential(0, tau);
beta ~ normal(0, sigma);
// Logistic likelihood
y ~ normal(C ./ (1 + exp(-(k + A * delta) 
                         .* (t - (m + A * gamma)))) +
             X * beta, epsilon);
}
```
## Stan fitting for prophet

- Prophet uses the L-BFGS algorithm from Stan to fit the GAM
- BFGS = Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm, quasi Newton method

# Future Talk's 
## regarding Prophet

- how the time dependet carrying capacity is determined ?
- how additional regressors are included ?
- how outliers are handeled ?


## theoretical background

- Stan models
- GAMS
- Baysian models
- L-BFGS
- Marcov chain Monte Carlo
